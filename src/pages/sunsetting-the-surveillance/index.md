title: 'Sunsetting deprecated messaging tools'

spoiler: Moving away from WhatsApp could take time. Here are dates, and more.

I'm moving away from several messaging products in the next 6 to 12 months. This post is written so I don't spring these changes on people who may expect me to be somewhere I won't be.

While the big picture effects are for now unclear, these changes will help me solve at least two _immediate problems_:
1. I cannot trust that the information and behaviours shared by my contacts into these questionable products will not be used against their interests. By using these products, I implicitly encourage people to also use them.
2. I cannot be open with my friends and family about my thoughts and experiences, nor can I expect them to talk and text with the same level of candor, knowing that the very act of communicating with fellow humans will then be used to [nudge our decisions](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook).

## What's out üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

WhatsApp, in 6 months.

Why? WhatsApp is run by Facebook Ôºç who have shown [again](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/07/facebook-privacy-changes_n_568345.html), [and again](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html), [and yet again](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/05/the-guardian-view-on-facebook-and-democracy-real-and-present-danger), that the company's interests work against the short- and long-term interests of we who don't pay money for its services.

Gmail and G Suite Ôºç for having similar business models. The shortlisted alternatives do not have certain features I find irreplaceable (at this time) and the timeline for replacement is 12 months. With luck, competitors' feature-sets will mature by then.

Sunsetting products I use is a staged process; the above are just the ones that are at the head of the line.

## What's in üéÅ

Signal ([about](https://www.signal.org/#signal), [download](https://www.signal.org/download/)) and Threema ([about](https://threema.ch/en/about), [download](https://threema.ch/en/download)). I have both of these installed, although I don't know anyone yet on Threema and it's crickets for me right now (its userbase seems to be in Germany, I don't live near there üá®üá¶).

Signal is opensource. Threema is [partially open](https://threema.ch/en/faq/source_code), and [audited regularly by external reviewers](https://threema.ch/en/faq/code_audit).

## The sunset plan üåÖ

I'll return to this post and update the plan as needed.

| Product | Deadline | Replacement |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| WhatsApp | February 2021 | [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download/), and [Threema](https://threema.ch/en/download) |
| Good ol' texts (SMS) | February 2021 | [Signal](https://www.signal.org/download/) |
| Gmail | August 2021 | [Tutanota](https://www.tutanota.com/), or [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) |
| Twitter | November 2021 | [Mastodon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPSbNdBmWKE) |
