## I asked myself: _"Why would I write?"_

I've written before: [on Medium](https://medium.com/@keywordnew), [on my uni blog](https://blogs.ubc.ca/chowdhurian/), and [for publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=NkPrDiYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

But I published rarely and writing for an audience didn't really stick as a habit. 

Why? I didn't know. 

I wanted to understand better before investing time writing again. 

## Motivation A: _"Write about what I know."_

This is not a good motivation for me.

It's tough for me to claim knowledge of a Thing or an Idea. I get a sense that I'm impersonating an expert. 

I **am** comfortable saying that I know something when my personal combination of experience is a fit. This happens mostly when I've invested enough time on that subject or in that space. 

The amount of time I feel is "enough" can be hugely variable. In most cases, using this reason to write will throw fuel on my impostor syndrome ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

So, ~~"Write about what I know."~~

## Motivation B: _"Write to share my interests."_

My interests are many, scattered, and range from the superficial to the obsessive. Which do I write about? 

I'm interested in coffee (it's recent development). But that only extends as far as knowing just enough to make myself a decent cafÃ© au lait. It's a shallow level of interest.

I'm interested in climate change. But I leave it to more driven folks to forge a path, and I'm happy to follow their lead.

Then there is the stuff about which I give a damn. Here is where I invest my time, in the hope that my effort contributes to its progress: open source, ethics, design, distributed (aka, remote) work, privacy, security. 

I'm getting closer to a good motivation, but it's not there yet. Strong interest doesn't answer the question: _"What is publishing on the web worth to me?"_

I wrote ["Anyone Can: Set up your own VPN"](https://medium.com/press-start-to-begin/anyone-can-ssh-into-a-server-scp-files-from-it-set-up-your-own-vpn-or-all-of-the-above-471a06e310bd) mostly to document a process for me to reference later. Yes, I'm interested in security and privacy, but it wasn't enough to publish it on the internet. I decided to go one more step and publish because it would surface the results of my digging for others looking for help (like I had done myself) doing the same thing.

So, speaking for myself, _"Write to share my interests"_ isn't enough of a reason.

## Motivation C: _"Write about stuff about which I want to connect with people."_

_Spoiler: I chose this._

This is what I've decided my blog is for. 

This is why I publish on the internet.

Yes, I know something about a Thing or Idea. At minimum, it's enough to ask questions and get answers from others who may have them.

And yes, I'm interested in the Thing. Enough to give a shit about how the Thing evolves and what we do with it.

But most of all, I want to have a conversation about the Thing with you, the Reader.

My personal blog is for sparking conversations I would like to have. The sort of conversation I wouldn't mind having if a stranger tapped me on the shoulder at a social and said "Hey, I'm interested in the Thing too! Do you have a few minutes to chat?"
