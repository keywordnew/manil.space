## I asked myself: _"Why would I write?"_

I've written before: [on Medium](https://medium.com/@keywordnew), [on my uni blog](https://blogs.ubc.ca/chowdhurian/), and [for publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=NkPrDiYAAAAJ&hl=en). 

But I published rarely and writing didn't really stick as a habit. 

Why? I didn't know. But I wanted to understand better before investing time again. 

## First motivation: _"Write about what I know."_

I see two reasons this is not a good motivation for me. 

First, it's tough to claim I know something. I get a sense that I'm impersonating an expert. The only exceptions are where my personal blend of experience coincidentally fits an ask. In most cases, using this reason to write will throw fuel on my impostor syndrome ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

Second, and this is related to the first, I like to grow. Growth is important, else I'd get bored. So let's say I want to learn a Thing? At which point do I know enough to write about the Thing?

So, ~~"Write about what I know."~~

## Second motivation: _"Write to share my interests."_

My interests are many, scattered, and range from the superficial to the obsessive. Which do I write about? 

I'm interested in coffee (it's recent development). But that only extends as far as knowing just enough to make myself a decent cafÃ© au lait (and thanks to my manager, I now do). It's a shallow level of interest.

I'm interested in climate change, but I leave it to more driven folks to push the issue, and I'm happy to follow their lead.

Then there is the stuff I really care about, the stuff into which I invest my time: open source, ethics, design, distributed work (aka remote work), privacy, security. There's promise here but it's still not enough. The last unanswered question is: "What is publishing on the internet worth to me?"

"Write to share my interests" doesn't answer that question.

## Third option: _"Write about stuff around which I want to connect with people."_

_Spoiler: I chose this._

This is what my blog is for. 

This is why I publish on the internet.

Yes, I know something about a Thing. At minimum, it's enough to ask questions.

And yes, I'm interested in the Thing.

But most of all, I want to have a conversation about the Thing with you, the Reader.

My personal blog is for sparking conversations I would like to have. The sort of conversation I wouldn't mind having if a stranger tapped me on the shoulder at a social and said "Hey, I'm interested in the Thing too! Do you have a few minutes to chat?"
